|  Rename missing items  |
--------------------------
This section is similar to the "Rename existing items" section, but in this case below are listed only items
that converter couldn't find in the newer world save. That's most likely because their registry names have changed
significantly. You have to manually edit each entry in this section and type the correct new item name (on the right
side).
