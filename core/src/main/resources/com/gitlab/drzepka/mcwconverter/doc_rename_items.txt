|  Rename items  |
------------------
Actions below will update items in Forge registry in a world save. They work just like RenameBlock actions, so you
should read documentation of the "Rename existing blocks" section.
The action syntax is as follows:
RenameItem <old block name> <old block id> -> <new block name> <new block id>
