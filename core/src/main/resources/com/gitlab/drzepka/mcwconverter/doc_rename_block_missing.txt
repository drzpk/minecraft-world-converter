|  Rename missing blocks  |
---------------------------
This section is similar to the "Rename existing blocks" section, but in this case below are listed only blocks
that converter couldn't find in the newer world save. That's most likely because their registry names have changed
significantly. You have to manually edit each entry in this section and type the correct new block name (on the right
side).
