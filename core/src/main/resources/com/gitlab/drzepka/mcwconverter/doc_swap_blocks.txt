|  Swap blocks in world  |
--------------------------
This section contains blocks that existed in old world save but disappeared in a new one. That could happen if a block
had changed completly, i.e. in old version block had an id and meta 1234:1, whereas in new version the same block
has id and meta 222:9. The converter generates only an action template with given old id and meta. It's your
responsibility to figure out what a block changed into. Note: swapping has a higher priority than renaming blocks
(the RenameBlock action), so if your rename and swap actions target the same block, id will be replaced by the latter
(but block registry name will be replaced normally by the RenameBlock action).
The action syntax is as follows:
SwapBlock oldid:oldmeta -> newid:newmeat (optional hint)
Both id and meta must be provided on both sides. Hint in parentheses is generated for better readability and is ignored
during world conversion.
