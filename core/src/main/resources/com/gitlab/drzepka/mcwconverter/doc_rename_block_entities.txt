|  Rename block entities  |
---------------------------
Actions below will rename block entities. Some of them aren't fully complete. That's because the converter was unable
to find their counterparts in new world save and you have to do it manually.
The action syntax is as follows:
RenameBlockEntity <old block entity name> -> <new block entity name>
RenameBlockEntity [multipart] <old block entity name> -> <new block entity name>
RenameBlockEntity [multipart] <old block entity name> -> [multipart] <new block entity name>
The optional 'multipart' prefix means that a block entity uses Forge multipart. Note that you can convert multipart
block entity to an ordinary block entity, not the other way around.
